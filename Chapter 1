# Introduction

Entrepreneurship and innovation have always held an irresistible fascination for me. From my childhood, I found myself immersed in creating and implementing solutions for a variety of challenges that arose in my path. Failure, being inevitable, became simultaneously my teacher and companion, and each stumble brought a lesson, though learning it is another story.

Over time, this continuous journey of trial and error led me to the development of an analysis and control method based on best practices in management and auditing. This method was refined over time, like table salt, allowing me to systematically assess the viability and trajectory of a product, often transcending the barriers of specific contexts and sectors.

Sharing this knowledge with the world would be a logical decision. After all, it would be sheer atrocity to keep something so useful and pragmatic to myself. And above all, to waste such a good title would be a shame, especially since it is laden with a homeopathic dose of irony.

Frankly, I recognize that cases of true enrichment in just fifteen days are rare. Indeed, I intend to demonstrate that external signs of wealth, when visible, are a faithful reflection of the wealth that already exists within that individual. Essentially, this mirror is often the culmination of an invisible process to those who only observe the final result. In other words, from the perspective of those not familiar with the behind-the-scenes of success, those who "get rich" in fifteen days may seem to have achieved their fortune suddenly, when, in reality, they already possessed a "wealth" pulsating in their veins long before its material manifestation.

This book proposes a deep dive into the notion and perception of value, concepts that, in my opinion, are often simplified and reduced to mere numbers; little figures or pixels at the top of a bank app screen on any smartphone. I intend to explore the notion and perception of “value,” demystifying what is often so subtle and multifaceted that it transcends our little lizard brains' understanding. By doing so, I hope to offer a new lens through which we can assess not only what we consider valuable but also how and why we attribute value to things in our lives and the world around us, thereby expanding our wealth in a pragmatic, methodical, and effective manner.
